        <p>Here you will find multiple (soon, hopefully) different tools to help with your adhd.
          <br>
          There is a section further down with a small selection of games to play with during your break times.</p>
        <p>I also plan to implement note taking as well as a login system to keep track of your sessions.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>A little further down you will find an "about me" section if you wish to get to know me. <br>
          My contact information is also there. </p>

    <h1>not just your regular IT student</h1>
    <p>
      I have a passion for fixing problems.  Lucky for me, I have a lot of them.<br>
      However, I will eventually run out of them. <br>
      Now you see this is a problem because again, I love problem solving.<br>
      The easiest solution I can think of is getting a job. <br></p>
    <h2>This is where you come in</h2>
      <p>
        I do not have 15 years of experience because<br> I was about 5 years old 15 years ago
        but, I am eager to learn new things.<br> You can find my contact information below if you believe in my potential.
      </p>
      <h3>Also, feel free to use the tools here <br>and don't hesitate to send me some feedback.<br> They're free <br><small>(Even if you can't get me a job)</small></h3>
